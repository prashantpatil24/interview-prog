# Q4. How do you handle junior developers?

## Answer

I believe mentoring is one of the most important responsibilities of a senior engineer.

Whenever a junior developer joins the team, I first help them understand:

- Project architecture
- Coding standards
- Git workflow
- Development process

I assign small, manageable tasks initially so they can become familiar with the codebase.

During development, I conduct regular code reviews and explain:

- Why a solution is good or bad
- React best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- Clean code principles
- Reusable component design

Instead of directly giving solutions, I encourage them to analyze the problem and think through possible approaches.

If they get stuck, I guide them with hints and explain the reasoning behind the solution.

I also conduct knowledge-sharing sessions on topics such as:

- React Hooks
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- API Integration
- Performance Optimization
- Debugging Techniques

My goal is to help junior developers become independent and confident engineers while ensuring the overall quality and maintainability of the project.

## How to handle API or Backend Error 

I handle backend errors using centralized exception handling so all APIs
return a consistent response format. I validate inputs first and return
appropriate HTTP status codes like 400, 404, 409, or 500. I create
custom exception classes for business errors, log detailed errors with
request IDs using a logging framework, and never expose stack traces to
clients. For external services, I use retries with exponential backoff,
timeouts, and circuit breakers where appropriate. I also monitor
production errors using tools like Sentry or Datadog. This approach
makes the application secure, maintainable, and easier to debug

## If you find bug what is approch 

My approach is: reproduce the bug, identify the root cause, assess its
impact, communicate it to the team, implement and test the fix, add
regression tests, get it reviewed through a PR, deploy it, and monitor
the application afterward. If the issue reveals a gap in the process, I
also suggest preventive improvements so the same type of bug doesn't
happen again


## "What would you do if, one day later, you realize your story point estimate was lower than the actual effort?"

> "As soon as I realize my estimate is inaccurate, I don't wait until
> the end of the sprint. I inform my Scrum Master and Tech Lead, explain
> why the estimate changed, and provide a revised estimate based on what
> I've learned. I keep stakeholders updated on the impact to the sprint
> and discuss whether we should adjust priorities or move some work if
> necessary. During the sprint retrospective, I analyze why the estimate
> was off---such as unclear requirements, hidden technical complexity,
> or unexpected dependencies---and use that learning to improve future
> estimations."

## Want to start new application

Whenever I integrate any application or third-party service into a React project,

I first understand the **business requirements** and study the **API or
SDK documentation**.

I design a **clean architecture by separating the UI**, custom hooks,
service layer, and API client instead of calling APIs directly from
components.

I implement **secure authentication,** centralize API calls with
interceptors, and manage state appropriately using local state, Context,
Redux Toolkit, or TanStack Query depending on the use case.

I also focus on l**oading states, error handling, accessibility**,
performance optimizations like lazy loading and memoization, and write
unit and integration tests.

Finally, I validate **the integration in staging, monitor it in
production**, and ensure it is maintainable and scalable.\"

# Design a Scalable E-commerce Frontend (2-Minute Answer)

> "For a scalable e-commerce frontend, I'd use a feature-based modular architecture with clear business domains such as Catalog, Cart, Checkout, Orders, and Authentication. This keeps teams independent and improves maintainability.
>
> For rendering, I'd adopt a hybrid strategy—SSR or ISR for SEO-critical pages like product listings and product details, while using CSR for authenticated areas such as dashboards, carts, and user profiles.
>
> I'd manage server state using TanStack Query because it provides caching, background refetching, retries, and request deduplication. For client state, I'd use Redux Toolkit or Zustand depending on application complexity, while avoiding Context API for frequently changing shared state.**
>
> Performance would be a priority from day one through route-based code splitting, lazy loading, virtualization for large lists, CDN-backed image optimization, HTTP caching, and continuous monitoring of Core Web Vitals.
>
> To support long-term scalability, I'd introduce an API abstraction layer, centralized error handling, feature flags for safe releases, comprehensive testing, monitoring, logging, and a reusable design system so multiple teams can develop independently while maintaining a consistent user experience."

# Production Page Suddenly Becomes Slow After a Release

## Senior-Level Answer (2 Minutes)

> "The first thing I'd determine is whether the slowdown is caused by the frontend, backend, rendering pipeline, network, or third-party integrations. Since it started immediately after a release, I'd initially treat it as a production regression.
>
> I'd review deployment timelines, compare release diffs, and evaluate whether a rollback or feature flag should be used if customer impact is significant.
>
> Next, I'd reproduce the issue using a production build instead of the development environment. I'd analyze the application using Chrome Performance, React Profiler, Network, and Memory tools while also reviewing Core Web Vitals and Real User Monitoring (RUM) data.
>
> I'd inspect JavaScript bundle size, API response times, third-party scripts, rendering performance, memory growth, and unnecessary React re-renders. If the issue only occurs in production, I'd rely on source maps, production traces, throttled network and CPU simulations, and telemetry because development builds often hide production bottlenecks.
>
> After identifying the root cause, I'd implement the appropriate optimization—whether that's reducing bundle size, optimizing rendering, improving caching, fixing API latency, or removing expensive third-party scripts—and verify the improvement using performance metrics before closing the incident."

# Behavioral Interview

# How Do You Mentor Junior Engineers?

## Senior-Level Answer (2 Minutes)

> "I mentor junior engineers by focusing not only on technical skills but also on engineering judgment. Rather than simply providing answers, I guide them through the reasoning process so they learn how to solve similar problems independently.
>
> I regularly use code reviews and pair programming to discuss debugging strategies, trade-offs, design decisions, and performance considerations. During reviews, I explain why a solution is preferred instead of only pointing out what's wrong.
>
> As engineers grow, I gradually increase their ownership—from fixing small bugs to leading complete features—while providing the architectural context needed to make informed decisions.
>
> I also work to create an environment where asking questions is encouraged, mistakes are treated as learning opportunities, and feedback is constructive. My goal is to help engineers become confident, independent contributors who can mentor others in the future."

# Real Example

## Performance Mentoring Story

> "One junior engineer was struggling with performance issues in a React screen. Instead of rewriting the implementation myself, I paired with them using React Profiler and Chrome Performance tools. Together we analyzed unnecessary re-renders, discussed optimization options, and evaluated the trade-offs of using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback. Rather than giving the solution directly, I encouraged them to identify the bottleneck and propose improvements. Over time, they became confident in diagnosing performance issues independently and eventually started helping other teammates solve similar problems."

---

# Interview One-Liners

### Scalable Architecture

> Use feature-based modules, hybrid rendering, dedicated server/client state management, performance optimization, and strong observability to build scalable frontends.

---

### Production Performance Issue

> Treat sudden production slowdowns as regressions, verify with production telemetry, profile the application, mitigate quickly using rollback or feature flags, then optimize based on measured bottlenecks.

---

### Mentoring

> I focus on building independent engineers by teaching problem-solving, encouraging ownership, providing architectural context, and creating a safe environment for learning and feedback.


# One-to-One Interview Questions

---

# 1. What was the biggest challenge you faced in your project, and how did you resolve it?

## Senior-Level Answer (2–3 Minutes)

> "One of the biggest challenges I faced was during the migration of a large e-commerce application from Angular to React. The product listing page displayed around 3,000 products, and initially the application rendered every product at once. As a result, the initial page load was slow, scrolling became laggy, and applying filters caused noticeable UI freezes.
>
> To understand the bottleneck, I started with React DevTools Profiler. The profiler showed that every time the filter state changed in the parent component, the entire product list subtree was re-rendering. The flamegraph confirmed that every `ProductCard` component was rendering again, even when its underlying product data hadn't changed.
>
> **After investigating further, we identified three primary causes:**
>
> - The parent component re-rendered whenever filter state changed.**
> - Inline callback functions such as `onAddToCart` created new function references on every render.**
> - Derived arrays and objects were recreated inside the render function, breaking referential equality and preventing memoization from working effectively.
>
> **To address these issues, we implemented several optimizations:**
>
> 1. Wrapped the `ProductCard` component with `React.memo()` so unchanged products would skip re-rendering.
> 2. Used `useCallback()` to stabilize event handler references passed to child components.
> 3. Memoized expensive derived values using `useMemo()` and avoided recreating objects and arrays unnecessarily.
> 4. Introduced list virtualization using `react-window`, ensuring that only visible products were rendered instead of all 3,000 items.
>
> After implementing these optimizations, we validated the improvements using React Profiler. The number of component renders dropped significantly, commit times decreased, scrolling became smooth, and overall page responsiveness improved considerably. The biggest lesson was that performance optimization should always be driven by measurement rather than assumptions."

---

## Root Cause

- Parent state updates triggered the entire subtree.
- New callback references on every render.
- New objects and arrays broke memoization.
- Large DOM (≈3,000 product cards).

---

## Investigation Tools

- React DevTools Profiler
- Flamegraph
- Chrome Performance
- React DevTools "Highlight Updates"

---

## Optimizations

- `React.memo()`
- `useCallback()`
- `useMemo()`
- `react-window`
- Stable props
- Avoid unnecessary object creation

---

## Results

- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Lower commit time
- Faster initial render
- Smooth scrolling
- Better user experience

---

## Interview One-Liner

> I first measured the problem using React Profiler, identified unnecessary component re-renders caused by unstable props and large DOM rendering, then optimized selectively with React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, and virtualization.

# Production Hotfix / Critical Bug Handling (Senior Interview)

## Q. What is your approach for handling a production hotfix or critical bug?

## Answer

Whenever a production issue is reported, my primary goal is to **restore service quickly while minimizing business impact**. I follow a structured incident management process.

---

# Step 1: Assess the Severity

First, I determine the priority of the issue.

| Priority | Example |
|----------|---------|
| **P1 (Critical)** | Application down, Login failure, Payment issue, Security vulnerability |
| **P2 (High)** | Major functionality affected with no workaround |
| **P3 (Medium)** | Minor functionality issue with a workaround |

For **P1 issues**, we immediately initiate the hotfix process.

---

# Step 2: Reproduce & Identify the Root Cause

Before making any code changes, I verify the issue.

Activities include:

- Review production logs
- Check monitoring dashboards
- Analyze error reports
- Reproduce the issue in Staging or Local environment
- Identify the root cause

### Common Monitoring Tools

- Azure Monitor
- Application Insights
- Splunk
- ELK Stack
- Datadog
- Grafana

---

# Step 3: Create a Hotfix Branch

Create a dedicated hotfix branch from the production branch.

```text
main (Production)
      │
      ▼
hotfix/login-issue
```

Best Practices:

- Branch from **main**
- Keep changes isolated
- Avoid unrelated modifications

---

# Step 4: Implement the Fix

During a hotfix:

- Make the smallest possible change
- Follow coding standards
- Avoid unnecessary refactoring
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Minimize deployment risk

---

# Step 5: Testing

Before deployment, perform targeted testing.

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing
- Regression Testing
- Smoke Testing

QA validates only the impacted functionality to speed up the release.

---

# Step 6: Code Review

Even for urgent fixes:

- Another senior developer reviews the code
- Verify no side effects
- Check security implications
- Validate performance impact

---

# Step 7: Deploy to Production

Deploy through the CI/CD pipeline.

Depending on the application, we may use:

- Blue-Green Deployment
- Canary Deployment
- Rolling Deployment

These deployment strategies reduce downtime and deployment risk.

---

# Step 8: Monitor Production

After deployment:

- Monitor application logs
- Check application health
- Verify error rates
- Confirm issue resolution
- Monitor business KPIs

Examples:

- Login Success Rate
- Payment Success Rate
- API Error Rate
- Response Time

---

# Step 9: Merge Back

Once production is stable:

Merge the hotfix into both production and development branches.

```text
      main
        ▲
        │
     hotfix
        │
        ▼
     develop
```

This prevents the same issue from reappearing in future releases.

---

# Step 10: Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

After the incident:

- Document the root cause
- Explain why it happened
- Add automated test cases
- Improve monitoring and alerting
- Update documentation
- Conduct a postmortem meeting

Goal:

Prevent similar issues from occurring again.

---

# What if the Hotfix Fails in Production?

## Answer

Every production deployment should have a **rollback strategy**.

If the hotfix introduces unexpected issues:

1. Roll back immediately to the last stable version using the CI/CD pipeline.
2. Restore application availability.
3. Investigate the issue.
4. Fix it in a new hotfix branch.
5. Redeploy after proper validation.

This minimizes downtime and business impact.

---

# Real Production Example (React)

In one of my projects, users were suddenly unable to log in after a backend API update.

### Root Cause

The backend team changed the authentication header format, but the frontend was still sending the old header.

### Resolution

- Identified the issue using production logs.
- Reproduced it in the staging environment.
- Created a hotfix branch.
- Updated the API integration.
- Performed smoke and regression testing.
- Deployed through Azure DevOps CI/CD.
- Monitored production logs after deployment.
- Verified login success rates returned to normal.

### Prevention

- Added automated integration tests.
- Improved API contract validation.
- Strengthened communication between frontend and backend teams.

# Senior-Level Interview Answer (2–3 Minutes)

> Whenever a production issue is reported, my first priority is to restore service with minimal business impact. I begin by assessing the severity—whether it's a P1, P2, or P3 incident. For critical issues like login failures, payment failures, or application outages, I immediately analyze production logs and monitoring tools such as Azure Monitor or Application Insights to identify the root cause. Once reproduced in a staging environment, I create a dedicated hotfix branch from the production branch and implement the smallest possible change, avoiding unnecessary refactoring. After unit, integration, regression, and smoke testing, the fix is reviewed by another senior engineer and deployed through our CI/CD pipeline using strategies like Blue-Green or Canary deployment when available. After deployment, I closely monitor logs, application health, API error rates, and business metrics to confirm the issue is resolved. Finally, I merge the hotfix into both the main and develop branches, perform a Root Cause Analysis, add automated test cases, and improve monitoring to prevent similar incidents in the future. If the hotfix causes unexpected issues, we immediately roll back to the last stable version while investigating further. This structured approach minimizes downtime and ensures long-term stability.
