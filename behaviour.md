# Q4. How do you handle junior developers?

## Answer

I believe mentoring is one of the most important responsibilities of a senior engineer.

Whenever a junior developer joins the team, I first help them understand:

- Project architecture
- Coding standards
- Git workflow
- Development process

I assign small, manageable tasks initially so they can become familiar with the codebase.

During development, I conduct regular code reviews and explain:

- Why a solution is good or bad
- React best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- Clean code principles
- Reusable component design

Instead of directly giving solutions, I encourage them to analyze the problem and think through possible approaches.

If they get stuck, I guide them with hints and explain the reasoning behind the solution.

I also conduct knowledge-sharing sessions on topics such as:

- React Hooks
- TypeScript
- Redux Toolkit
- API Integration
- Performance Optimization
- Debugging Techniques

My goal is to help junior developers become independent and confident engineers while ensuring the overall quality and maintainability of the project.

## How to handle API or Backend Error 

I handle backend errors using centralized exception handling so all APIs
return a consistent response format. I validate inputs first and return
appropriate HTTP status codes like 400, 404, 409, or 500. I create
custom exception classes for business errors, log detailed errors with
request IDs using a logging framework, and never expose stack traces to
clients. For external services, I use retries with exponential backoff,
timeouts, and circuit breakers where appropriate. I also monitor
production errors using tools like Sentry or Datadog. This approach
makes the application secure, maintainable, and easier to debug

## If you find bug what is approch 

My approach is: reproduce the bug, identify the root cause, assess its
impact, communicate it to the team, implement and test the fix, add
regression tests, get it reviewed through a PR, deploy it, and monitor
the application afterward. If the issue reveals a gap in the process, I
also suggest preventive improvements so the same type of bug doesn't
happen again


## "What would you do if, one day later, you realize your story point estimate was lower than the actual effort?"

> "As soon as I realize my estimate is inaccurate, I don't wait until
> the end of the sprint. I inform my Scrum Master and Tech Lead, explain
> why the estimate changed, and provide a revised estimate based on what
> I've learned. I keep stakeholders updated on the impact to the sprint
> and discuss whether we should adjust priorities or move some work if
> necessary. During the sprint retrospective, I analyze why the estimate
> was off---such as unclear requirements, hidden technical complexity,
> or unexpected dependencies---and use that learning to improve future
> estimations."

## Want to start new application

Whenever I integrate any application or third-party service into a React project,

I first understand the **business requirements** and study the **API or
SDK documentation**.

I design a **clean architecture by separating the UI**, custom hooks,
service layer, and API client instead of calling APIs directly from
components.

I implement **secure authentication,** centralize API calls with
interceptors, and manage state appropriately using local state, Context,
Redux Toolkit, or TanStack Query depending on the use case.

I also focus on l**oading states, error handling, accessibility**,
performance optimizations like lazy loading and memoization, and write
unit and integration tests.

Finally, I validate **the integration in staging, monitor it in
production**, and ensure it is maintainable and scalable.\"


## Scenario-Based Interview Questions

# 1. How would you migrate a React monolith to a micro frontend architecture?

Answer

I would **avoid a full rewrite and migrate incrementally** using the
Strangler Fig pattern.

Steps:

1.  Identify independent business domains.
    -   Authentication
    -   Dashboard
    -   Orders
    -   Payments
    -   Profile

2.  Extract one feature at a time into its own application.

3.  Use a shell (host) application that loads micro frontends
    > dynamically using Module Federation.

4.  Keep shared dependencies like React, React DOM, and the design
    > system as singletons.

5.  Migrate routing gradually.

6.  Once all features are migrated, retire the monolith.


# 2. How would you handle version conflicts between multiple remote applications?

Answer

Version conflicts are one of the biggest challenges in Module
Federation.

I would:

-   Share React as a singleton.
-   Keep common libraries shared.
-   Use semantic versioning.
-   Maintain compatibility across teams.
-   Avoid duplicate dependencies.

Example:
```javascript
    shared: {
        react: {
            singleton: true,
            requiredVersion: \"\^18.2.0\"
        },
    \"react-dom\": {

    singleton: true

    }
}
```
For internal libraries:

-   Publish shared packages.
-   Use versioning.
-   Avoid breaking changes.

# 3. What happens if a remote application is unavailable? How would you
provide a fallback UI?

Answer

A remote may fail because of:
-   Network issue
-   Deployment issue
-   CDN issue
-   Server down

I would use:
-   React Error Boundary
-   Suspense fallback
-   Retry mechanism
-   Graceful degradation

Example:
```javascript
    <Suspense fallback={\<Loading /\>}\>
        <ErrorBoundary fallback={\<ErrorPage /\>}\>
            <RemoteDashboard /\>
        </ErrorBoundary\>
    </Suspense\>
 ```   

Users should still be able to use the rest of the application.

# 4. How would you implement authentication across multiple micro
frontends?

Answer

Authentication should be centralized.

Implementation:

-   Login once.
-   Store JWT in secure HttpOnly cookies if possible.
-   Share authentication through the shell.
-   Refresh tokens centrally.
-   Never let every micro frontend implement login independently.

# 5. How would you share a design system across teams?

Answer

Create a shared component library.

# 6. How would you optimize performance when using Module Federation?

Answer

I would:

-   Share React as a singleton.
-   Lazy load remote applications.
-   Load only required remotes.
-   Enable browser caching.
-   Use CDN.
-   Split bundles.
-   Compress assets.
-   Prefetch important remotes.
-   Optimize images.

Example:

```javascript
`const Orders = React.lazy(() =\> import(\"orders/App\"));
```
Avoid loading all remotes during the initial page load.

# 7. How would you implement CI/CD for independently deployed micro frontends?

Answer

Each micro frontend should have its own pipeline.

```javascript
    Git
    ↓
    Build
    ↓
    Unit Tests
    ↓
    Integration Tests
    ↓
    Deploy
    ↓
    CDN
    ↓
    Host loads latest remote
```
Benefits:

-   Independent deployment
-   Faster releases
-   Team autonomy
-   Easier rollback

The shell application should not require rebuilding every time a remote
changes.

# 8. How would you monitor errors across multiple micro frontend applications?

Answer

Centralized monitoring is essential.

Use:
-   Error Boundaries
-   Logging
-   Monitoring tools
-   Distributed tracing

# 9. When would you choose micro frontends over a monolithic frontend?

Answer
 I would choose micro frontends when:

    ✅ Multiple teams work independently.
    ✅ Independent deployments are needed.
    ✅ The application is very large.
    ✅ Different business domains exist.

Examples:

-   Banking
-   E-commerce
-   Healthcare
-   Enterprise ERP

I would not choose micro frontends for:

-   Small applications
-   MVPs
-   Teams with fewer than 5 developers
-   Projects with simple deployment needs

# 10. How do you ensure consistent user experience and routing across independently deployed micro frontend applications?

Answer

The shell application should own:

-   Global navigation
-   Header
-   Footer
-   Theme
-   Authentication
-   Routing

Guidelines:

-   Maintain a shared design system.
-   Use consistent spacing, colors, and typography.
-   Define routing conventions.
-   Keep global state (authentication, user preferences) in the shell.
-   Use shared error pages and loading indicators.


# How to Debug a Slow React Application

## 1. React DevTools Profiler

The React Profiler is the first tool to use.

Look for:

- Components rendering too frequently
- Long render durations
- Unnecessary re-renders

---

## 2. Highlight Component Re-renders

React DevTools:

```
Settings
    ↓
General
    ↓
Highlight updates when components render
```

This visually shows components re-rendering.

---

## 3. Check Render Count

If a component renders hundreds of times unnecessarily:

- Check props
- Check state
- Check context updates

---

## 4. Chrome Performance Tab

Steps:

1. Open DevTools
2. Go to **Performance**
3. Click **Record**
4. Perform the slow action
5. Stop recording

Look for:

- Long Tasks (> 50 ms)
- JavaScript execution time
- Layout calculations
- Paint/Repaint operations
- Flame chart hotspots

---

## 5. Detect Expensive Calculations

If expensive computations run on every render:

Use:

```jsx
useMemo()
```

---

## 6. Check Network Requests

DevTools → **Network**

Look for:

- Slow APIs
- Duplicate requests
- Large payloads
- Waterfall loading

---

## 7. Use Why Did You Render

Detect unnecessary renders.

```bash
npm install @welldone-software/why-did-you-render
```

Useful during development.

---

## 8. Check Context Performance

Every context value change causes all consumers to re-render.

Solutions:

- Split contexts
- Memoize provider values
- Use selector-based context patterns

---

## 9. Optimize Large Lists

Use virtualization/windowing libraries.

Examples:

- `react-window`
- `react-virtualized`

Only visible items are rendered.

---

## 10. Analyze Bundle Size

Large bundles slow startup.

Build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Webpack:

```bash
npm install webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

Look for:

- Large libraries
- Duplicate dependencies
- Dead code

---

## 11. Check Memory Leaks

Symptoms:

- App slows over time
- Memory usage keeps increasing

Common causes:

- Uncleared timers
- Event listeners
- WebSockets
- Unreleased object references

---

## 12. Measure Web Vitals

Important production metrics:

```javascript
import { onLCP, onINP } from "web-vitals";
```

### Benchmarks

| Metric | Good |
|---------|------:|
| **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)** | < 2.5 s |
| **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)** | < 200 ms |
| **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** | < 0.1 |

---

# Senior React Interview Answer

> When debugging a slow React application, I first use the React DevTools Profiler to identify expensive renders and unnecessary re-renders. Then I inspect the browser Performance tab for long tasks, layout shifts, and JavaScript execution. Next, I analyze network requests, bundle size, context updates, and large list rendering. Finally, I check for memory leaks and monitor Core Web Vitals like LCP, INP, and CLS to ensure good production performance.

# Typical Real-World Investigation Flow (Slow React Application)

When users report that a React page is slow, follow this investigation process:

1. Reproduce the issue.
2. Open **React DevTools Profiler**.
3. Identify expensive component renders.
4. Check the **Network** tab for slow APIs.
5. Inspect the **Performance** tab for long tasks.
6. Identify unnecessary re-renders.
7. Verify Context updates.
8. Analyze bundle size.
9. Measure Core Web Vitals.
10. Optimize only the actual bottleneck.

> **Golden Rule:** Measure first, optimize second.

---

# Interview Answer (Short Version)

> I start with React DevTools Profiler to identify expensive component renders. Then I use Chrome Performance and Network tabs to analyze JavaScript execution, API latency, and rendering costs. I check for unnecessary re-renders, context updates, large lists, memory leaks, and bundle size issues. After identifying the bottleneck, I optimize using memoization, virtualization, code splitting, or state restructuring as appropriate.

#  How Would You Optimize a Slow React Application?

### Interview Answer

> I first reproduce the issue and use React DevTools Profiler to identify expensive renders. Then I inspect Chrome Performance and Network tabs to analyze JavaScript execution, rendering costs, and API latency. I check for unnecessary re-renders, context updates, memory leaks, large lists, and bundle size. Once the root cause is identified, I optimize using techniques such as `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, virtualization (`react-window`), code splitting (`React.lazy` and `Suspense`), state colocation, context splitting, and API/request optimization. Finally, I validate improvements using Core Web Vitals like LCP, INP, and CLS.


# 12. How Would You Optimize a Slow React Application?

## Investigation Flow

### Step 1: Use React DevTools Profiler

Identify:

- Slow components
- Repeated renders
- Expensive calculations
- Long commit durations

---

### Step 2: Check Render Counts

Use **Why Did You Render** during development.

```bash
npm install @welldone-software/why-did-you-render
```

It helps identify unnecessary component re-renders.

---

### Step 3: Optimize Re-renders

Use:

- `React.memo`
- `useMemo`
- `useCallback`

Only apply memoization after confirming it solves an actual bottleneck.

---

### Step 4: Optimize Large Lists

Use virtualization libraries:

- `react-window`
- `react-virtualized`

Instead of rendering 50,000 rows, render only the visible rows.

---

### Step 5: Code Splitting

```jsx
const Dashboard = React.lazy(() => import("./Dashboard"));
```

Load components only when needed.

---

### Step 6: Bundle Analysis

Analyze bundle size.

Look for:

- Heavy libraries
- Duplicate packages
- Dead code

Common tools:

- webpack-bundle-analyzer
- Vite Bundle Visualizer

# Design a Scalable E-commerce Frontend (2-Minute Answer)

> "For a scalable e-commerce frontend, I'd use a feature-based modular architecture with clear business domains such as Catalog, Cart, Checkout, Orders, and Authentication. This keeps teams independent and improves maintainability.
>
> For rendering, I'd adopt a hybrid strategy—SSR or ISR for SEO-critical pages like product listings and product details, while using CSR for authenticated areas such as dashboards, carts, and user profiles.
>
> I'd manage server state using TanStack Query because it provides caching, background refetching, retries, and request deduplication. For client state, I'd use Redux Toolkit or Zustand depending on application complexity, while avoiding Context API for frequently changing shared state.**
>
> Performance would be a priority from day one through route-based code splitting, lazy loading, virtualization for large lists, CDN-backed image optimization, HTTP caching, and continuous monitoring of Core Web Vitals.
>
> To support long-term scalability, I'd introduce an API abstraction layer, centralized error handling, feature flags for safe releases, comprehensive testing, monitoring, logging, and a reusable design system so multiple teams can develop independently while maintaining a consistent user experience."

# Production Page Suddenly Becomes Slow After a Release

## Senior-Level Answer (2 Minutes)

> "The first thing I'd determine is whether the slowdown is caused by the frontend, backend, rendering pipeline, network, or third-party integrations. Since it started immediately after a release, I'd initially treat it as a production regression.
>
> I'd review deployment timelines, compare release diffs, and evaluate whether a rollback or feature flag should be used if customer impact is significant.
>
> Next, I'd reproduce the issue using a production build instead of the development environment. I'd analyze the application using Chrome Performance, React Profiler, Network, and Memory tools while also reviewing Core Web Vitals and Real User Monitoring (RUM) data.
>
> I'd inspect JavaScript bundle size, API response times, third-party scripts, rendering performance, memory growth, and unnecessary React re-renders. If the issue only occurs in production, I'd rely on source maps, production traces, throttled network and CPU simulations, and telemetry because development builds often hide production bottlenecks.
>
> After identifying the root cause, I'd implement the appropriate optimization—whether that's reducing bundle size, optimizing rendering, improving caching, fixing API latency, or removing expensive third-party scripts—and verify the improvement using performance metrics before closing the incident."

# Behavioral Interview

# How Do You Mentor Junior Engineers?

## Senior-Level Answer (2 Minutes)

> "I mentor junior engineers by focusing not only on technical skills but also on engineering judgment. Rather than simply providing answers, I guide them through the reasoning process so they learn how to solve similar problems independently.
>
> I regularly use code reviews and pair programming to discuss debugging strategies, trade-offs, design decisions, and performance considerations. During reviews, I explain why a solution is preferred instead of only pointing out what's wrong.
>
> As engineers grow, I gradually increase their ownership—from fixing small bugs to leading complete features—while providing the architectural context needed to make informed decisions.
>
> I also work to create an environment where asking questions is encouraged, mistakes are treated as learning opportunities, and feedback is constructive. My goal is to help engineers become confident, independent contributors who can mentor others in the future."

---

## Mentoring Principles

---

# Real Example

## Performance Mentoring Story

> "One junior engineer was struggling with performance issues in a React screen. Instead of rewriting the implementation myself, I paired with them using React Profiler and Chrome Performance tools. Together we analyzed unnecessary re-renders, discussed optimization options, and evaluated the trade-offs of using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback. Rather than giving the solution directly, I encouraged them to identify the bottleneck and propose improvements. Over time, they became confident in diagnosing performance issues independently and eventually started helping other teammates solve similar problems."

---

# Interview One-Liners

### Scalable Architecture

> Use feature-based modules, hybrid rendering, dedicated server/client state management, performance optimization, and strong observability to build scalable frontends.

---

### Production Performance Issue

> Treat sudden production slowdowns as regressions, verify with production telemetry, profile the application, mitigate quickly using rollback or feature flags, then optimize based on measured bottlenecks.

---

### Mentoring

> I focus on building independent engineers by teaching problem-solving, encouraging ownership, providing architectural context, and creating a safe environment for learning and feedback.


# One-to-One Interview Questions

---

# 1. What was the biggest challenge you faced in your project, and how did you resolve it?

## Senior-Level Answer (2–3 Minutes)

> "One of the biggest challenges I faced was during the migration of a large e-commerce application from Angular to React. The product listing page displayed around 3,000 products, and initially the application rendered every product at once. As a result, the initial page load was slow, scrolling became laggy, and applying filters caused noticeable UI freezes.
>
> To understand the bottleneck, I started with React DevTools Profiler. The profiler showed that every time the filter state changed in the parent component, the entire product list subtree was re-rendering. The flamegraph confirmed that every `ProductCard` component was rendering again, even when its underlying product data hadn't changed.
>
> **After investigating further, we identified three primary causes:**
>
> - The parent component re-rendered whenever filter state changed.**
> - Inline callback functions such as `onAddToCart` created new function references on every render.**
> - Derived arrays and objects were recreated inside the render function, breaking referential equality and preventing memoization from working effectively.
>
> **To address these issues, we implemented several optimizations:**
>
> 1. Wrapped the `ProductCard` component with `React.memo()` so unchanged products would skip re-rendering.
> 2. Used `useCallback()` to stabilize event handler references passed to child components.
> 3. Memoized expensive derived values using `useMemo()` and avoided recreating objects and arrays unnecessarily.
> 4. Introduced list virtualization using `react-window`, ensuring that only visible products were rendered instead of all 3,000 items.
>
> After implementing these optimizations, we validated the improvements using React Profiler. The number of component renders dropped significantly, commit times decreased, scrolling became smooth, and overall page responsiveness improved considerably. The biggest lesson was that performance optimization should always be driven by measurement rather than assumptions."

---

## Root Cause

- Parent state updates triggered the entire subtree.
- New callback references on every render.
- New objects and arrays broke memoization.
- Large DOM (≈3,000 product cards).

---

## Investigation Tools

- React DevTools Profiler
- Flamegraph
- Chrome Performance
- React DevTools "Highlight Updates"

---

## Optimizations

- `React.memo()`
- `useCallback()`
- `useMemo()`
- `react-window`
- Stable props
- Avoid unnecessary object creation

---

## Results

- Reduced unnecessary re-renders
- Lower commit time
- Faster initial render
- Smooth scrolling
- Better user experience

---

## Interview One-Liner

> I first measured the problem using React Profiler, identified unnecessary component re-renders caused by unstable props and large DOM rendering, then optimized selectively with React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, and virtualization.

---

# 2. When Can These Optimizations Make Performance Worse?

## Senior-Level Answer (2 Minutes)

> "React performance optimizations such as `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` should be applied selectively rather than everywhere. Each of these techniques introduces its own overhead, so using them without measurement can actually degrade performance.
>
> For example, `React.memo` performs a shallow comparison of props on every parent render. If the component is lightweight, the comparison itself may cost more than simply rendering the component again.
>
> Similarly, `useMemo` and `useCallback` require React to retain previous values and compare dependency arrays on every render. If the computation being memoized is inexpensive or the callback isn't passed to memoized children, the extra bookkeeping provides little or no benefit.
>
> In our project, we used these optimizations only where profiling showed measurable improvements. Heavy components such as `ProductCard` benefited from `React.memo`, and `useCallback` was useful for event handlers passed several levels down to memoized children. For simple UI components like buttons or labels, we intentionally avoided memoization because the render cost was negligible.
>
> We continuously validated these decisions using React Profiler, and in some cases removing unnecessary memoization actually reduced render time because it eliminated comparison overhead. The key lesson is to measure first, optimize second, and only keep optimizations that provide measurable improvements."
